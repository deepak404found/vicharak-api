# 🚀 Django Rest Framework (DRF) Tutorials

## 🤔 What is Django Rest Framework (DRF)?

- Django Rest Framework (DRF) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.
- It extends Django’s capabilities by providing built-in functionalities for API development, including serialization, authentication, permissions, and browsable API interfaces.
- DRF simplifies the process of creating RESTful web services, making it an essential tool for modern web applications.
- 🌐 It is widely used in applications requiring API communication, mobile app backends, and microservices architecture.
- 💡 With DRF, developers can quickly build scalable and secure APIs with minimal effort.
